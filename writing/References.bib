  abstract = {This paper proposes a new methodology for multidimensional poverty measurement consisting of an identification method {$\rho$}k that extends the traditional intersection and union approaches, and a class of poverty measures M{$\alpha$}. Our identification step employs two forms of cutoff: one within each dimension to determine whether a person is deprived in that dimension, and a second across dimensions that identifies the poor by `counting' the dimensions in which a person is deprived. The aggregation step employs the FGT measures, appropriately adjusted to account for multidimensionality. The axioms are presented as joint restrictions on identification and the measures, and the methodology satisfies a range of desirable properties including decomposability. The identification method is particularly well suited for use with ordinal data, as is the first of our measures, the adjusted headcount ratio M0. We present some dominance results and an interpretation of the adjusted headcount ratio as a measure of unfreedom. Examples from the US and Indonesia illustrate our methodology.},

  abstract = {Early in 2018, the United Nations Development Program's Human Development Report Office (HDRO) and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI) agreed to adjust and unify their methodologies on poverty measurement and consider indicator improvements, in order to better monitor the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This paper sets out the specifications of a joint global Multidimensional Poverty Index first published in 2018, which is an internationally comparable measure of acute poverty that captures the multiple deprivations poor people experience with respect to health, education and living standards. It builds on the original MPI launched in 2010, and an innovative MPI launched in 2014. The best features of both of these are subsumed in the joint global MPI 2018, which also reflects new data possibilities to better align the global MPI to the Sustainable Development Goals. Because the objective of revising the MPI to create a more credible and legitimate measure of multidimensional poverty that enables comparisons across countries using existing data was challenging to realize, the paper first sets out five key principles for a global poverty measure related to data coverage, communicability, comparability, disaggregation, and robustness. Drawing on expert interventions, a global consultation, empirical trials, and these principles, the paper then explains conceptually the motivation and nature of adjustments that were made to five of the ten included indicators. It also recognizes desirable changes that could not be made due to data constraints \textendash{} for example including data on the environment, work, and security, or on intrahousehold inequalities. And it identifies key issues for future research related to household composition and the use of land and livestock variables.},

This paper studies one of these opportunity costs: we estimate the agricultural productivity of children aged 10 to 15 years old using the LSMS-ISA panel survey in Tanzania. Since child labor can be endogenous, we exploit the panel structure of the data and instrument child labor with changes in the age composition of the household. One day of child work leads to an increase in production value by roughly US\$0.89. Children enrolled in school work 26 fewer days than nonenrolled children. Compensating enrolled children for loss in income can be accomplished with monthly payments of \$1.92. However, a complete simulation of a hypothetical conditional cash transfer shows that even \$10/month transfers would fail to achieve universal school enrollment of children aged 10 to 15 years old.},

Along the intensive margin, further research that uses household and firm-level panel data of energy consumption may help identify how energy consumers around the world respond to weather shocks. Research on technology adoption, e.g. air conditioners, will further our understanding of the extensive margin adjustments and their costs.

We develop a simple model which suggests the possibility of an inverted-U relationship between land holdings and child labor. Using a unique data set that has child labor hours it is found that, controlling for child, household and village characteristics, the turning point beyond which more land leads to a decline in child labor occurs around 4 ac of land per household.},

The estimated "altruism coefficient" (defined in the paper) indicates the degree of altruism. Parent altruism is of evident interest in designing welfare programmes. Indeed, we show that parent altruism implies positive effects of parental income on child outcomes. Thus the effectiveness of income transfer programmes targeted at child poverty is conditional on the degree of parent altruism. The prediction of the altruistic model that is tested is that the demand for child goods is increasing in adult consumption, prices constant. M-demands provide the natural estimation framework. The test is conducted for a number of items of adult consumption. For all but tobacco the data decisively reject the null of selfishness. This result is robust to replacing child clothing with child schooling or child labour. We argue that the aberrant behaviour of tobacco may be understood in terms of its addictive properties. We also suggest that the results are consistent with fathers being less altruistic than mothers, tobacco being a predominantly male good. JEL codes: C2 I2 O1 R2},

Besides price and yield incentives, agroforestry for climate change adaptation and preservation of other ecosystem services (e.g. greenhouse gas mitigation) should be promoted, while recognizing that farmer's willingness to invest in tree planting links with informal rights for trees and customary tenure systems. Finally, extension services and communal measures that mediate overall wellbeing should be complementary measures.

Yet, not much has actually been done to include the various dimensions of deprivation into the practical definition and measurement of poverty. Existing attempts along that direction consist of aggregating various attributes into a single index through some arbitrary function and defining a poverty line and associated poverty measures on the basis of that index. This is merely redefining more generally the concept of poverty, which then essentially remains a one dimensional concept. The present paper suggests that an alternative way to take into account the multi-dimensionality of poverty is to specify a poverty line for each dimension of poverty and to consider that a person is poor if he/she falls below at least one of these various lines. The paper then explores how to combine these various poverty lines and associated one-dimensional gaps into multidimensional poverty measures. An application of these measures to the rural population in Brazil is also given with poverty defined on income and education.},

Using a hierarchical meta-analysis that allows us to both estimate the mean effect and quantify the degree of variability across 55 studies, we find that deviations from moderate temperatures and precipitation patterns systematically increase conflict risk.

In contrast, aggregate macroeconomic productivity of entire wealthy countries is reported not to respond to temperature, while poor countries respond only linearly. Resolving this conflict between micro and macro observations is critical to understanding the role of wealth in coupled human-natural systems and to anticipating the global impact of climate change. Here we unify these seemingly contradictory results by accounting for non-linearity at the macro scale. We show that overall economic productivity is non-linear in temperature for all countries, with productivity peaking at an annual average temperature of 13\textdegree C and declining strongly at higher temperatures. The relationship is globally generalizable, unchanged since 1960, and apparent for agricultural and non-agricultural activity in both rich and poor countries. These results provide the first evidence that economic activity in all regions is coupled to the global climate and establish a new empirical foundation for modelling economic loss in response to climate change, with important implications. If future adaptation mimics past adaptation, unmitigated warming is expected to reshape the global economy by reducing average global incomes roughly 23\% by 2100 and widening global income inequality, relative to scenarios without climate change. In contrast to prior estimates, expected global losses are approximately linear in global mean temperature, with median losses many times larger than leading models indicate.},

Using multiple decades of comprehensive data from both the US and Mexico, 3 we find that suicide rates rise 0.7\% in US counties and 2.1\% in Mexican municipalities for a 1 \textbullet{} C 4 increase in monthly average temperature. This effect is similar in hotter versus cooler regions and has 5 not diminished over time, indicating limited historical adaptation. Analysis of depressive language 6 in {$>$}600 million social media updates further suggests that mental wellbeing deteriorates during 7 warmer periods. We project that unmitigated climate change (RCP8.5) could result in a combined 8 9-40 thousand additional suicides (95\% CI) across the US and Mexico by 2050, representing an 9 change in suicide rates comparable to the estimated impact of economic recessions, 5 suicide prevention 10 programs, 6 or gun restriction laws. 7 11 Climate is increasingly understood to influence many dimensions of human health, 1, 8, 9 affecting health 12 outcomes ranging from vector-borne disease mortality to rates of cardiac arrest. 9, 10 These relationships have 13 been shown to occur through direct physical stress or insults to the body (e.g. heatstroke or cyclone-caused 14 drowning), changes in disease ecology (e.g. seasonal flu or malaria), and/or changes in socioeconomic 15 conditions that support human health (e.g. drought-induced famine). Recent work has also demonstrated 16 that social conflicts between individuals, which cause intentional injuries and mortality, are particularly 17 responsive to changes in temperature, perhaps due to changes in underlying economic conditions or altered 18 individual-level aggressiveness. 11 19 Potential linkages between climatic conditions and mental health are also increasingly hypothesized. 3 How-20 ever, unlike other key health outcomes, there remains limited quantitative evidence linking temperature to 21 suicide and related mental health outcomes. 12, 13 Determining whether or not suicide responds to climatic 22 conditions is important, as suicide alone causes more deaths globally than all forms of interpersonal and 23 intergroup violence combined, 4 is among the top 10-15 causes of death globally, among the top 5 causes of 24 lost life-years in many wealthy regions, 14 and among the top 5 causes of death for individuals aged 10-54 25 in the US. 15 It is the only cause of death among the top 10 in the US for which age-adjusted mortality rates 26 are not declining. 16 Thus even modest changes in suicide rates due to climate change could portend large 27 changes in the associated global health burden, particularly in wealthier countries where current suicide rates 28 are relatively high and/or on the rise.},

  abstract = {Efficient responses to climate change require accurate estimates of both aggregate damages and where and to whom they occur. While specific case studies and simulations have suggested that climate change disproportionately affects the poor, large-scale direct evidence of the magnitude and origins of this disparity is lacking. Similarly, evidence on aggregate damages, which is a central input into the evaluation of mitigation policy, often relies on country-level data whose accuracy has been questioned. Here we assemble longitudinal data on economic output from over 11,000 districts across 37 countries, including previously nondigitized sources in multiple languages, to assess both the aggregate and distributional impacts of warming temperatures. We find that local-level growth in aggregate output responds non-linearly to temperature across all regions, with output peaking at cooler temperatures ({$<$}10\textdegree C) than estimated in earlier country analyses and declining steeply thereafter. Long difference estimates of the impact of longer-term (decadal) trends in temperature on income are larger than estimates from an annual panel model, providing additional evidence for growth effects. Impacts of a given temperature exposure do not vary meaningfully between rich and poor regions, but exposure to damaging temperatures is much more common in poor regions. These results indicate that additional warming will exacerbate inequality, particularly across countries, and that economic development alone will be unlikely to reduce damages, as commonly hypothesized. We estimate that since 2000, warming has already cost both the US and the EU at least \$4 trillion in lost output, and tropical countries are {$>$}5\% poorer than they would have been without this warming.},

As a consequence the income of rural populations will change, and with it the incentives for people to remain in rural areas. Using data from 115 countries between 1960 and 2000, we analyze the effect of differential warming trends across countries on the probability of either migrating out of the country or from rural to urban areas. We find that higher temperatures in middle-income economies increased migration rates to urban areas and to other countries. In poor countries, higher temperatures reduced the probability of migration to cities and to other countries, consistently with the presence of severe liquidity constraints. In middle-income countries, migration represents an important margin of adjustment to global warming, potentially contributing to structural change and even increasing income per worker. Such a mechanism, however, does not seem to work in poor economies.},

The model indicates that the higher the adult unemployment rate in the skilled sector, the lesser is the time allocated by an unskilled adult towards schooling of her child. We also find that an increase in the unskilled adult's wage may or may not decrease child labour in the presence of unemployment. The model predicts that an increase in child wage increases schooling and human capital growth rate only if the adults in the unskilled sector earn less than subsistence consumption expenditure. As the responsiveness of skilled wage to human capital increases, schooling and human capital growth rates increase. The model dynamics bring out the importance of education efficiency and parental human capital in human capital formation of the child. In the case of an inefficient education system, generations will be trapped into low level equilibrium. Only in the presence of an efficient education system, steady growth of human capital is possible. Suitable policies that may be framed to escape the child labour trap are discussed as well.},

The studies we have included in this review illustrate the impact that assets can have on children's outcomes in the area of health, education, and child labor. Overall, the studies reviewed show that asset ownership improves children's health conditions, advance schooling outcomes, and decrease incidence of child labor.

However, quantitative production figures are necessary to provide coffee stakeholders and policy makers with evidence to justify immediate action. Using data from the northern Tanzanian highlands, we demonstrate for the first time that increasing night time (Tmin) temperature is the most significant climatic variable responsible for diminishing C. arabica yields between 1961 and 2012. Projecting this forward, every 1\textdegree C rise in Tmin will result in annual yield losses of 137{$\pm$}16.87kgha-1 (P=1.80e-10). According to our ARIMA model, average coffee production will drop to 145{$\pm$}41kgha-1 (P=8.45e-09) by 2060. Consequently, without adequate adaptation strategies and/or substantial external inputs, coffee production will be severely reduced in the Tanzanian highlands in the near future. Attention should also be drawn to the arabica growing regions of Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ethiopia and Kenya, as substantiated time series evidence shows these areas have followed strikingly similar minimum temperature trends. This is the first study on coffee, globally, providing essential time series evidence that climate change has already had a negative impact on C. arabica yields.},

The complexity of the phenomenon implies that a large set of policy instruments can be used to address child labor or can affect child labor. This review of 33 impact evaluations provides a comprehensive look at pathways through which social protection (credit and microfinance, cash transfers, vouchers, food programs), and labor programs affect child labor. Despite the complexity of integrating findings across different child labor definitions, implementation contexts, and policy instruments, some patterns emerge. For example, programs that address child labor by reducing the vulnerability of the household produce the desired effect. Transfers reduced child labor in most cases. Similarly, programs that help the household cope with exposure to risk, for example, health insurance, reduce household reliance on child labor. On the other hand, policies aimed at increasing adult household members' participation in the labor market or entrepreneurial activities, can generate demand for adolescent and child work. Of course, such programs are an important component of anti-poverty strategies, but they could be modified and integrated with additional interventions to ensure that they do not produce adverse effects on child labor. While progress has been made over the past decade, there is still much to learn about the effects of public policy on the labor participation of many children in developing countries.},

It develops a simple theoretical model, which uses child labor, training, and schooling to maximize household income over time, subject to resource constraints. Then, it conducts an empirical analysis using randomized trial data, which were collected for the evaluation of the 2006 Nicaragua conditional cash transfer program. This social program transfers wealth to poor families in rural areas, conditional on children's school attendance and health check-ups. In addition, for one third of the beneficiaries, there is a further wealth transfer to start a non-agricultural business. The paper finds that the conditional cash transfer program affected the volume and quality of child labor, reducing it in the aggregate and steering it towards skill-forming activities. Specifically, the program appears to have reduced the use of child labor for household chores and farm work, while increasing it for the non-traditional, skill-forming activities related to commerce and retail. Moreover, the paper finds that the source behind the increase in skill-forming child labor is not the basic component, which provides a transfer for paying for schooling and health services, but it's the business-grant component, which provides a household grant for the creation of a micro business or a new economic activity.},

We apply this method to the temperature climate of the modern United States and find that, despite evidence that populations adapt, the marginal product of temperature has remained unchanged during 1970-2010, with high temperatures having low net value. Integrating marginal products recovers a value function for temperature, describing the causal effect of non-marginal climate changes net of adaptive re-optimization.

The objectives of the paper are to highlight the many remaining gaps in the empirical literature and to provide guidelines for improving the current Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) literature that seeks to incorporate human health and adaptation in its framework. I begin by presenting the conceptual and methodological issues associated with the measurement of the effect of temperature extremes on health, and the role of adaptation in possibly muting these effects. The main conclusion that emerges from the literature is that despite the wide variety of data sets and settings most studies find that temperature extremes lead to significant reductions in health, generally measured with excess mortality. Regarding the role of adaptation in mitigating the effects of extreme temperature on health, the available knowledge is limited, in part due to the few real-world data sets on adaptation behaviors. Finally, the paper discusses the implications of the currently available evidence for assessments of potential human health impacts of global climate change.},

  abstract = {The question of diverging interests and preferences within couples over the use of household resources and the consequences of these conflictual views has been present for a long time in the development literature, albeit in a somewhat scattered way. This paper selectively reviews the abundant literature that offers insights into the intra-household decision-making process, the strategies put in place by individuals to secure their access to private resources, and the role of the changing economic environment in altering these mechanisms. This paper bridges different strands of the social sciences and exemplifies the complementarities among them. The main features of household organization are described to set the scene for the individual strategies introduced to bypass intra-household negotiations and secure access to private resources. These strategies include efforts to maintain access to income-earning opportunities and secrecy about income and savings. This paper also discusses attempts to maintain or tilt the balance of power within the household through the use of violence, on the one hand, and marital and fertility choices on the other hand. Finally, this paper describes directions for future research aimed at improving the understanding of household behaviour and responses to economic stimuli.},

These findings are consistent with the theoretical model offered in the paper. They highlight that imperfect agricultural labor markets are important determinants of child labor.

The variation comes from the number of hours worked and from which tasks are considered child labor. Furthermore, we use two different surveys during data collection. In the first, an adult (proxy) reports on the daily activities of each child in the household, and in the second, the children (direct) respond themselves. Proxy and direct responses are less likely to match when the definition includes time spent on household chores, which is typically underestimated for girls. We find that proxy reporting of whether the child worked in the past week is 5.5 percentage points lower than the direct reporting. Within households, misreporting is significantly more likely for girls than for boys. Across households, however, misreporting is associated with child's age, not gender. Furthermore, among girls misreporting is associated with the number of younger children at home. Our analysis helps explain why varying measures of child labor used in the literature yield different results.},

  abstract = {M ore than one in five children in the world work. Most of these working children live in poor countries. This paper is concerned with the relationship between current family economic status and child labor in poor countries. There are two distinct strands of research. The first considers whether working while young influences a household's current economic status through the economic contribution of children (Manacorda 2006), and the impact of child labor on local labor markets (Basu and Van 1998). The second examines whether current economic status influences the decision to send children to work. Understanding economic influences on child time allocation is important for the political economy of child labor regulation and the design of child labor policy (Doepke and Zilibotti 2005). This second strand of research is the focus of this paper, which examines child time allocation responses to experimental variation in a cash transfer program in Ecuador. In the recent literature on child labor responses to variation in economic status, reviewed in the next section, there is a debate on the extent to which child time allocation responds to income among poor households. There are many theoretical reasons why poverty may cause child labor. However, the time allocation of children and household incomes are joint outcomes of a single decision-making process , so establishing a causal relationship is difficult. Many correlates of family Poverty Alleviation and Child Labor \textdagger{} Poor women with children in Ecuador were selected at random for a cash transfer that is less than 20 percent of median child labor earnings. Poor families with children in school at the time of the award use the transfer to postpone the child's entry into the labor force. Students in families induced to take up the transfer by the experiment reduce paid employment by 78 percent and unpaid economic activity inside their home by 32 percent. Time in unpaid household services increases, but overall time spent working declines. (},

This paper gives some background to HadRM3H; it also presents anomaly maps of the projected future changes in European temperature, rainfall and potential evapotranspiration (PET, estimated using a variant of the Penman formula). The future simulations of temperature and rainfall, following the SRES A2 emissions scenario, suggest that most of Europe will experience warming in all seasons, with heavier precipitation in winter in much of western Europe (except for central and northern parts of the Scandinavian mountains) and drier summers in most parts of western and central Europe (except for the north-west and the eastern part of the Baltic Sea). Particularly large temperature anomalies ({$>$}6\textdegree C) are projected for north-east Europe in winter and for southern Europe, Asia Minor and parts of Russia in summer. The projected PET displayed very large increases in summer for a region extending from southern France to Russia. The unrealistically large values could be the result of an enhanced hydrological cycle in HadRM3H, affecting several of the input parameters to the PET calculation. To avoid problems with hydrological modelling schemes, PET was re-calculated, using empirical relationships derived from observational values of temperature and PET.},

  abstract = {Integrated assessment models (IAMs), models that couple the human and natural systems, have been widely used by the climate change research community to project the emissions consequences of economic activity and the technical potential and cost of mitigation options ; to perform cost-benefit analysis (CBA) to determine the optimal future path of GHG emissions and mitigation costs; and to assess the magnitude and incidence of climate impacts and associated economic cost of climate damages. DICE (Nordhaus, 1994), the first fully coupled IAM to account for the feedbacks of climate change on the economy, introduced the device of a climate damage function which was global in scope but with a highly simplified and aggregated treatment of either the meteorological drivers of impacts (global mean temperature change) or their physical manifestations across different endpoints, economic sectors and geographic regions. In the intervening two decades a succession of IAMs has followed this lead, incorporating climate feed-backs with limited complexity-or more commonly disregarding them altogether, even as computational advances have made possible increasingly detailed representations of the economic activity to which climate change poses risks. As a consequence there has been slow progress in modeling climate adaptation responses, and, to the best of our knowledge, no study has accounted for the implications of impacts and adaptation for the climate stabilization strategies. Omitting climate change impacts and adaptation responses from IAM studies can affect their results in important ways. For one, climate feedbacks can reduce the pool of mitigation options which can under-state the cost of mitigation policies; e.g., water shortages can limit the potential for hydropower and biofuel production could be limited by negative impacts on crop productivity. Omitting adaptation responses from the analysis can also bias the results in a number of ways; e.g., (a) adaptation responses could dampen the economic cost of climate impacts; (b) adaptation responses could change the baseline emissions trajectory (e.g., greater air conditioning in response to higher temperatures could lead to higher emissions), making it more difficult to reach stabilization targets; and (c) adaptation investments could crowd out mitigation investment making it more costly to mitigate. Given the importance of climate feedbacks and adaptation responses , a natural question is why have they been largely left out of IAMs? A reason that is commonly given is the inadequate empirical basis for characterizing the responses to be inserted into models. For the few studies that do attempt to incorporate these responses, engineering or natural science process simulations are often used to fill the gap; however, the latter models typically are computationally expensive , capture only a single link of the causal chain from meteorology to physical endpoints to shocks to the economy, and, similar to IAMs, themselves need to be parameterized based on scarce empirical evidence. The good news is that there has been a recent flurry of empirical research (econometric studies) in the economics literature that holds the promise of offering the necessary empirical foundation for simulating climate change impacts and adaptation. However, IAMs and process models have yet to take advantage of this potential. Why? First, econo-metric models capture more than one part of the causal chain, and because they are reduced form and not structural, the results are more difficult to incorporate into structural IAMs or process models. Second, econometric studies of impacts and adaptation are typically not done with IAMs in mind, and tend to focus at a level of detail (spatial and/ or sectoral) that is far beneath IAMs' level of aggregation. The upshot is that heroic efforts on the part of the modeler are often necessary to translate econometric results into useable representations within simulation models. To help address this disconnect, in May 2012 a two-day workshop was organized at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) in Cambridge, MA by the Program on Integrated Assessment Model Development , Diagnostics, and Inter-model comparison (PIAMDDI), a research program funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science. 1 The purpose of the workshop was to bring together key empirical researchers and integrated assessment modelers to (1) begin the discussion on devising ways to incorporate existing empirical work into models (translational work) and (2) develop ideas for joint research so that future empirical work may be better integrated into models (development work). The workshop consisted of sessions in six topic areas: water resources, energy, land use and migration, agriculture , extreme events and sea level rise, and health. Each session included reviews of the state of the art in empirical research and integrated assessment modeling of climate impacts and adaptation, given by an empirical researcher and a modeler, followed by a facilitated discussion. The papers in this special issue are an outgrowth of these presentations. The first two papers focus on water. Sheila Olmstead's review focus-es on the scope of the existing empirical literature on water supply, demand , and climate change adaptation, and its potential usefulness to incorporation into IA modeling. The paper begins by surveying estimates of the economic consequences of climate change impacts on water supply and demand in specific river basins, and the ability of},

  abstract = {This paper describes the construction of an updated gridded climate dataset (referred to as CRU TS3.10) from monthly observations at meteorological stations across the world's land areas. Station anomalies (from 1961 to 1990 means) were interpolated into 0.5\textdegree{} latitude/longitude grid cells covering the global land surface (excluding Antarctica), and combined with an existing climatology to obtain absolute monthly values. The dataset includes six mostly independent climate variables (mean temperature, diurnal temperature range, precipitation, wet-day frequency, vapour pressure and cloud cover). Maximum and minimum temperatures have been arithmetically derived from these. Secondary variables (frost day frequency and potential evapotranspiration) have been estimated from the six primary variables using well-known formulae. Time series for hemispheric averages and 20 large sub-continental scale regions were calculated (for mean, maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation totals) and compared to a number of similar gridded products. The new dataset compares very favourably, with the major deviations mostly in regions and/or time periods with sparser observational data. CRU TS3.10 includes diagnostics associated with each interpolated value that indicates the number of stations used in the interpolation, allowing determination of the reliability of values in an objective way. This gridded product will be publicly available, including the input station series (http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/ and http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/cru/). \textcopyright{} 2013 Royal Meteorological Society},

In fact, these models generalize the whole family of generalized linear models {$\eta$}( x) = {$\beta$}' x, where {$\eta$}( x) = g({$\mu$}( x)) is some transformation of the regression function. We use the local scoring algorithm to estimate the functions f\textsubscript{j}(x\textsubscript{j}) nonparametrically, using a scatterplot smoother as a building block. We demonstrate the models in two different analyses: a nonparametric analysis of covariance and a logistic regression. The procedure can be used as a diagnostic tool for identifying parametric transformations of the covariates in a standard linear analysis. A variety of inferential tools have been developed to aid the analyst in assessing the relevance and significance of the estimated functions: these include confidence curves, degrees of freedom estimates, and approximate hypothesis tests. The local scoring algorithm is analogous to the iterative reweighted least squares algorithm for solving likelihood and nonlinear regression equations. At each iteration, an adjusted dependent variable is formed and an additive regression model is fit using the backfitting algorithm. The backfitting algorithm cycles through the variables and estimates each coordinated function by smoothing the partial residuals.},

Due to rising temperatures throughout the tropics, pressures for adaptation will be greatest in some of the poorest parts of the world where the adaptive capacity is least abundant. We discuss both autonomous (market driven) and planned adaptations, distinguishing: (a) those that can be undertaken with existing technology, (b) those that involve development of new technologies, and (c) those that involve institutional/market and policy reforms. The paper then proceeds to identify which of these adaptations are currently modeled in integrated assessment studies and related analyses at global scale. This, in turn, gives rise to recommendations about how these models should be modified in order to more effectively capture climate change adaptation in the farm and food sector. In general, we find that existing integrated assessment models are better suited to analyzing adaptation by relatively well-endowed producers operating in market-integrated, developed countries. They likely understate climate impacts on agriculture in developing countries, while overstating the potential adaptations. This is troubling, since the need for adaptation will be greatest amongst the lower income producers in the poorest tropical countries. This is also where policies and public investments are likely to have the highest payoff. We conclude with a discussion of opportunities for improving the empirical foundations of integrated assessment modeling with an emphasis on the poorest countries.},

Yet previous studies have not shown that violence can be attributed to the global climate, only that random weather events might be correlated with conflict in some cases. Here we directly associate planetary-scale climate changes with global patterns of civil conflict by examining the dominant interannual mode of the modern climate, the El Ni\~no/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Historians have argued that ENSO may have driven global patterns of civil conflict in the distant past, a hypothesis that we extend to the modern era and test quantitatively. Using data from 1950 to 2004, we show that the probability of new civil conflicts arising throughout the tropics doubles during El Ni\~no years relative to La Ni\~na years. This result, which indicates that ENSO may have had a role in 21\% of all civil conflicts since 1950, is the first demonstration that the stability of modern societies relates strongly to the global climate. \textcopyright{} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Child labor was found to be associated with a number of adverse health outcomes, including but not limited to poor growth, malnutrition, higher incidence of infectious and system-specific diseases, behavioral and emotional disorders, and decreased coping efficacy. Quality of included studies was rated as fair to good. Conclusion and recommendations Child labor remains a major public health concern in LMICs, being associated with adverse physical and mental health outcomes. Current efforts against child labor need to be revisited, at least in LMICs. Further studies following a longitudinal design, and using common methods to assess the health impact of child labor in different country contexts would inform policy making.},

  abstract = {We study how exposure to extreme temperatures in early periods of child development is related to adult economic outcomes measured 30 y later. Our analysis uses administrative earnings records for over 12 million individuals born in the United States between 1969 and 1977, linked to fine-scale, daily weather data and location and date of birth. We calculate the length of time each individual is exposed to different temperatures in utero and in early childhood, and we estimate flexible regression models that allow for nonlinearities in the relationship between temperature and long-run outcomes. We find that an extra day with mean temperatures above 32 \textdegree C in utero and in the first year after birth is associated with a 0.1\% reduction in adult annual earnings at age 30. Temperature sensitivity is evident in multiple periods of early development, ranging from the first trimester of gestation to age 6-12 mo. We observe that household airconditioning adoption, which increased dramatically over the time period studied, mitigates nearly all of the estimated temperature sensitivity. temperatures | fetal origins | early life health | long-run wellbeing | climate change E xposure to extreme temperatures has harmful contempora-neous effects on human health due to an overload on the body's capacity to self-regulate (e.g., refs. 1-6). Fetuses and infants are especially sensitive to hot temperatures because their thermoregulatory and sympathetic nervous systems are not fully developed (7, 8), with prior research showing that extreme heat during the prenatal period and shortly after birth has adverse effects on birth weight and infant mortality (9, 10). Yet much less is known about the long-run persistence of the effects of temperature or whether they influence other measures of human capital, such as adult labor market outcomes. This study attempts to fill this gap by providing evidence on the long-term consequences of early-life exposure to extreme temperatures , using data on over 12 million individuals born in the United States between 1969 and 1977 and observed 30 y later. The possibility that temperature can have lasting effects on human development may be particularly consequential in light of the growing consensus among scientists that climate change is contributing to a gradual warming of the earth. Researchers predict an increase in global mean temperatures, largely driven by a rightward shift in the upper tail of the temperature distribution. For example, the number of days with mean temperature above 32 \textdegree C in the average county in the United States is forecasted to increase from about 1/y to about 43/y by 2070-2099 (1). As such, estimates of the long-term consequences of exposure to extreme heat on individuals' wellbeing may serve as important inputs into calculations of the social cost of carbon (11). These estimates may also help explain whether the persistent correlation between income and temperature around the world in part operates through a causal link between early-life exposure and adult productivity (see refs. 12-19 for a broader literature on the relationship between the environment and economic development). We also examine whether observed forms of adaptation have the ability to mitigate some of the direct biological effects of temperature on long-term economic outcomes. Adaptation to extreme temperatures could occur through physiological acclima-tization (i.e., changes in skin blood flow, metabolic rate, oxygen consumption, and core temperatures) (21), short-run temporal substitution between activities (i.e., limiting time spent outside), or the adoption of more permanent measures of temperature control such as air conditioning (AC), which we study here. Our analysis uses newly available data from the US Census Bureau's Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamic (LEHD) Files, which contain information on adult labor market outcomes linked to county and exact date of birth. We combine these longitudinal earnings records with fine-scale daily weather data that spans the United States on a 2.5-km \texttimes{} 2.5-km grid. We use these data to construct the length of time an individual is exposed to different temperatures in several focal windows of early childhood development. We then estimate flexible statistical models, designed to identify nonlinearities in the long-run effect of early-life temperature exposure on adult labor market outcomes. Early-life exposure to temperature is potentially correlated with other determinants of human capital development. For example, children born in different seasons within the year differ in their socioeconomic backgrounds (22), and families non-randomly choose to live in geographic locations with distinct climates. The empirical challenge of this paper is to isolate the causal relationship between early-life temperature exposure and adult outcomes from the possible confluence of these other factors. We address this challenge by focusing on the following Significance Recent work has demonstrated how exposure to extreme temperatures influences contemporaneous health outcomes, such as infant mortality and morbidity. Additional research has explored how shocks to the early-life environment affect long-run human capital outcomes. However, there is little evidence on the possible long-term consequences of exposure to extreme temperatures in utero or in early childhood. This paper begins to fill this gap by studying long-run effects of temperature on measures of individuals' economic wellbeing around age 30 y. We find that adult economic outcomes are negatively correlated with prenatal exposure to days with mean temperatures exceeding 32 \textbullet{} C. This relationship is completely mitigated among individuals born in counties with high rates of access to air conditioning.},

The NREGA offers 100 days of guaranteed work to adults from rural households with the intention to help households smooth consumption during lean agricultural seasons. Providing employment opportunities to households can affect intra-household allocation of time and resources by changing income and bargaining power. We use the phased roll out of NREGA to different districts and measure the difference-indifference between districts that received the program early relative to those that received it later. In our analysis we look at the impact on children when adults take-up NREGA work. On one hand, additional income in the household can increase resources spent on children s education and reduce child labor. However, if wages in the economy increase or adults take-up new jobs, child labor could increase. Our results show an increase in time spent on education for younger children and an increase in time spent working outside the household for older children.},

  abstract = {Concern about the human impact of climate change has led to predictions of how people living in areas vulnerable to drought, flood, and temperature changes will respond to such events. Early studies warned that climate change would lead to dramatic increases in human migration as households became unable to adapt to the impacts of climate change. More recently, empirical studies focused on observed climate events and trends have documented how migration flows vary as a function of both the severity of the event and the ability of the household to migrate, among other factors. In this paper, we provide a systematic review of this literature, based on a conceptual framework in which climate shocks (e.g., drought, floods, or temperature extremes) affect (a) household capability to migrate, by depleting household resources necessary for migration, and (b) household vulnerability in staying, by increasing the risk that a household falls (further) into poverty. In combination, these factors help explain four key patterns seen in the empirical literature: (1) climate-induced migration is not necessarily more prevalent among poorer households; (2) climate-induced migration tends to be more prevalent for long-distance domestic moves than local or international moves; (3) slow-onset climate changes (such as droughts) are more likely to induce increased migration than rapid-onset changes (such as floods); and (4) the severity of climate shocks impacts migration in a nonlinear fashion, with impacts influenced by whether the capability or vulnerability channel dominates.},

Our results show that negative rainfall deviations and cyclones reduce the probability of attending school and encourage young men and, to a greater extent, women to enter the work force, and they reduce their French and math test scores. Less wealthy households are most likely to experience this school-To-work transition in the face of rainfall shocks. The finding is consistent with poorer households having less savings and more limited access to credit and insurance, which reduces their ability to cope with rainfall shortages. We also find that there are both contemporaneous and lagged effects of the weather shocks, and that they are of a similar magnitude. Our findings are robust to the use of a linear probability model, as well as a wide range of definitions of rainfall variations.},

We estimate that temperature and rainfall anomalies caused a total net displacement of 5 million people during the period 1960-2000, i.e. a minimum of 128,000 people every year. Based on medium UN population and IPCC climate change projections, we expect future weather anomalies to lead to an additional annual displacement of 11.8 million people by the end of the 21st century.},

  abstract = {Migration in response to climatic hazards or changes in climatic conditions can unfold in a variety of ways, ranging from barely observable, incremental changes in pre-existing migration flows to abrupt, non-linear population movements. The adoption of migration instead of in situ adaptation responses, and the high degree of variability in potential migration outcomes, in part reflects the presence of thresholds or tipping points within the processes of human-environment interaction through which climate adaptation and migration take place. This article reviews and makes linkages between existing research in climate adaptation, migration system dynamics, residential preferences, and risk perception to identify and explore the functioning and importance of thresholds. Parochial examples from the author's published research on climate adaptation and migration in rural North America are used to illustrate. Six types of thresholds in response to climate hazards are identified: (1) Adaptation becomes necessary; (2) Adaptation becomes ineffective; (3) Substantive changes in land use/livelihoods become necessary; (4) In situ adaptation fails, migration ensues; (5) Migration rates become non-linear; and (6) Migration rates cease to be non-linear. Movement across thresholds is driven by context-specific characteristics of climate events, natural systems, and/or human systems. Transition from incremental to non-linear migration can be accelerated by people's perceptions, by actions of influential individuals or groups, and by changes in key infrastructure, services, or other community assets. Non-linear climate migration events already occur at local and sub-regional scales. The potential for global scale, non-linear population movements later this century depends heavily on future greenhouse gas emission trends. The ability to identify and avoid thresholds that tip climate migration into a non-linear state will be of growing concern to policy makers and planners at all levels in coming decades. This article forms part of a special issue of this journal dedicated to the late Graeme Hugo, and the author draws heavily on past research by Professor Hugo and colleagues.},

Results indicate that regardless of gender, in urban areas, a higher minimum wage reduces child labor in household work. In rural areas a similar result applies for girls while household labor does rise for boys. The minimum wage has virtually no impact on child work outside of the home across urban and rural areas.},

Some economists contest this viewpoint, arguing that wealthier countries have the luxury of investing more heavily in efforts to conserve biodiversity. Under this assumption, we expect a U-shaped relationship between per capita wealth and proportion of species conserved. We test this environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) using estimates of per capita income and deforestation rates (index of biodiversity threat) for 35 tropical countries. A prior analysis [Dietz, S., Adger, W.N., 2003. Economic growth, biodiversity loss and conservation effort. Journal of Environmental Management, 68:23-35] using conventional regression techniques failed to provide any support for the parabolic relationship predicted by the EKC hypothesis. Here, we introduce the use of quantile regression and spatial filtering to reanalyze this data, addressing issues of heteroskedasticity and spatial autocorrelation. We note that preliminary analysis using these methods provides some initial evidence for an EKC. However, a series of panel analyses with country-specific dummy variables eliminated or even reversed much of this support. A closer examination of conservation practices and environmental indicators within the countries, particularly those countries that drove our initial support, suggests that wealth is not a reliable indicator of improved conservation practice. Our findings indicate that an EKC for biodiversity is overly simplistic and further exploration is required to fully understand the mechanisms by which income affects biodiversity. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In an absolute sense, these changing conditions constitute direct evidence of anthropogenic climate change. However, human evaluation of weather as either normal or abnormal will also be influenced by a range of factors including expectations, memory limitations, and cognitive biases. Here we show that experience of weather in recent years- rather than longer historical periods-determines the climatic baseline against which current weather is evaluated, potentially obscuring public recognition of anthropogenic climate change. We employ variation in decadal trends in temperature at weekly and county resolution over the continental United States, combined with discussion of the weather drawn from over 2 billion social media posts. These data indicate that the remarkability of particular temperatures changes rapidly with repeated exposure. Using sentiment analysis tools, we provide evidence for a "boiling frog" effect: The declining noteworthiness of historically extreme temperatures is not accompanied by a decline in the negative sentiment that they induce, indicating that social normalization of extreme conditions rather than adaptation is driving these results. Using climate model projections we show that, despite large increases in absolute temperature, anomalies relative to our empirically estimated shifting baseline are small and not clearly distinguishable from zero throughout the 21st century.},

We find that plot characteristics, credit constraints and availability of climate-related information explain the adoption of several of these practices. In relative terms, we also find that even when financial limitations are binding, making climate-related information available can still motivate farmers to adapt. Policy implications are that the deepening of extension access with information on the appropriate adaptation strategies is crucial to help farmers make adaptation choices. The need to foster credit markets for easy accessibility and affordability by farmers or otherwise strengthening access to assets is also important.},

Here we develop a metric-called "record equivalent draws" (RED)-based on record high (low) temperature observations, and show that changes in RED approximate changes in the likelihood of extreme high (low) temperatures. Since we also show that this metric is independent of the specifics of the underlying temperature distributions, RED estimates can be aggregated across different climates to provide a genuinely global assessment of climate change. Using data on monthly average temperatures across the global landmass we find that the frequency of extreme high temperatures increased 10-fold between the first three decades of the last century (1900-1929) and the most recent decade (1999-2008). A more disaggregated analysis shows that the increase in frequency of extreme high temperatures is greater in the tropics than in higher latitudes, a pattern that is not indicated by changes in mean temperature. Our RED estimates also suggest concurrent increases in the frequency of both extreme high and extreme low temperatures during 2002-2008, a period when we observe a plateauing of global mean temperature. Using daily extreme temperature observations, we find that the frequency of extreme high temperatures is greater in the daily minimum temperature time-series compared to the daily maximum temperature time-series. There is no such observable difference in the frequency of extreme low temperatures between the daily minimum and daily maximum. \textcopyright{} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

This article investigates views of extension agents on children working.One hundred and sixty-seven Ethiopian agricultural extension agents provided their views in a questionnaire on child labour in agriculture, complemented by key-informant interviews.'Child labour' is not easily understood as a significant problem in agriculture. Domestic work is a burden for rural girls in particular. There is a need to disaggregate the tasks that boys and girls are undertaking. Agricultural extension staff are found to be an important stakeholder group for addressing child labour in agriculture, because they are knowledgeable about the realities of rural livelihoods, observe labour practices and can suggest sensible ways to address labour demands. As agricultural productivity usually refers to annual yield per hectare, it may be timely to also consider productivity in terms of reduced child labour per hectare. Labour saving technologies are required. Awareness of children's rights and of the hazards of child labour in agriculture is required at many levels, combined with improved political coherence on the issue.Extension agents' views/suggestions confirm they are an important stakeholder group for an issue not directly within their mandate. Extension and education officials need to work together to foster the next generation of farmers, particularly focusing on rural girls.This is the first study of agricultural extension agents' views on child labour in agriculture. \textcopyright{} 2013 \textcopyright{} 2013 Wageningen University.},

  abstract = {Agriculture is unique among economic sectors in the nature of impacts from climate change. The production activity that transforms inputs into agricultural outputs involves direct use of weather inputs (temperature, solar radiation available to the plant, and precipitation). Previous studies of the impacts of climate change on agriculture have reported substantial differences in outcomes such as prices, production, and trade arising from differences in model inputs and model specification. This article presents climate change results and underlying determinants from a model comparison exercise with 10 of the leading global economic models that include significant representation of agriculture. By harmonizing key drivers that include climate change effects, differences in model outcomes were reduced. The particular choice of climate change drivers for this comparison activity results in large and negative productivity effects. All models respond with higher prices. Producer behavior differs by model with some emphasizing area response and others yield response. Demand response is least important. The differences reflect both differences in model specification and perspectives on the future. The results from this study highlight the need to more fully compare the deep model parameters, to generate a call for a combination of econometric and validation studies to narrow the degree of uncertainty and variability in these parameters and to move to Monte Carlo type simulations to better map the contours of economic uncertainty. \textcopyright{} 2013 International Association of Agricultural Economists.},

Some empirical evidence shows that child labor tends to increase as land holding increases, or there is an inverted U-shaped curve relationship between the probability of putting children to work and land holding. This paper shows that the relationship between use of children as laborers and land holding is nuanced. Child labor generally decreases as per capita land holding increases, but there can be an upward bump in the relationship between child labor and landholding near the middle of the range of land per capita. The bump can be explained theoretically by the relationship between the marginal productivity of a child worker on the farm and the marginal value placed on his/her education at different levels of wealth. This pattern is repeated in three surveys conducted in Zimbabwe, in 2001, 2007-8, and 2010-11. From the perspective of policy making, the policy maker should be alerted that the programs to promote school retention should not necessarily focus only on the poorest households in rural areas. There is a high probability that middle-wealth households put their children to work, and this probability may change by some other factors such as gender of child and agro-ecological conditions.},

For both models, the relationship between per capita income and per capita CO2emissions and the relationship among per capita income, per capita energy use, and per capita CO2emissions are analyzed respectively between 1980 and 2010, using the panel data estimation techniques with the application of Driscoll-Kraay Standard Errors. Yet, for the first model, data are analyzed for 26 OECD countries with high income levels, while for the second model, data are examined for 52 emerging countries. The results of both models show that N-shape and an inverted N-shape relationship for cubic functional form are observed. Thus, the results do not support the EKC hypothesis, which implies that environmental degradation cannot be solved automatically by economic growth.},

First theoretically it is shown that the child labour equilibrium can be eliminated by empowering a proportion of the parents with a self-employment opportunity. Then it is shown that if these parents completely abstain from the labour market and in addition treat their own children as a potential alternative to outside labour, then a reverse pattern of child labour emerges. Children of self-employed parents receive full schooling at low wages, but work at high wages. Both scenarios (low or high wage) are possible in equilibrium, and child labour may occur only in the self-employment sector. We then consider recent Indian data on child labour and school enrolment, and provide preliminary estimates of the probability of a child working when parents are self-employed. Though the empirical work is at a very early stage, there seems to be a significantly positive correlation between child labour and self-employment status of the parents.},

A welfarist interpretation of global poverty lines is augmented by the idea of normative functionings, the cost of which varies across countries. In this light, current absolute measures are seen to ignore important social effects on welfare, while popular strongly-relative measures ignore absolute levels of living. It is argued that a new hybrid measure is called for, combining absolute and weakly-relative measures consistent with how national lines vary across countries. Illustrative calculations indicate that we are seeing a falling incidence of poverty globally over the last 30 years. This is mainly due to lower absolute poverty counts in the developing world. While fewer people are poor by the global absolute standard, more are poor by the country-specific relative standard. The vast bulk of poverty, both absolute and relative, is now found in the developing world.},

  abstract = {The United States produces 41\% of the world's corn and 38\% of the world's soybeans. These crops comprise two of the four largest sources of caloric energy produced and are thus critical for world food supply. We pair a panel of county-level yields for these two crops, plus cotton (a warmer-weather crop), with a new fine-scale weather dataset that incorporates the whole distribution of temperatures within each day and across all days in the growing season. We find that yields increase with temperature up to 29\textdegree{} C for corn, 30\textdegree{} C for soybeans, and 32\textdegree{} C for cotton but that temperatures above these thresholds are very harmful. The slope of the decline above the optimum is significantly steeper than the incline below it. The same nonlinear and asymmetric relationship is found when we isolate either time-series or cross-sectional variations in temperatures and yields. This suggests limited historical adaptation of seed varieties or management practices to warmer temperatures because the cross-section includes farmers' adaptations to warmer climates and the time-series does not. Holding current growing regions fixed, area-weighted average yields are predicted to decrease by 30-46\% before the end of the century under the slowest (B1) warming scenario and decrease by 63-82\% under the most rapid warming scenario (A1FI) under the Hadley III model. agriculture panel analysis time series cross section farmer adaptation W ith evidence accumulating that greenhouse gas concentrations are warming the world's climate, research focuses increasingly on estimating impacts that may occur under different warming scenarios and how economies might adapt to changing climatic conditions. Agriculture is a key focus because of its direct connection to climate. Although agriculture comprises a small share of GDP in the United States, the U.S. persists in being the world's largest agricultural producer and exporter of agricultural commodities, so impacts in the U.S. could have broad implications for food supply and prices worldwide. At the same time, debate continues about whether warming will be a net gain or loss for agriculture in currently temperate climates like that of the United States (1-8). In this paper, we estimate the link between weather and yields for the three crops with the largest production value in the United States: corn, soybeans, and cotton. Corn and soybeans, the nation's most prevalent crops, are the predominant source of feed grains used in cattle, dairy, poultry, and hog production. Corn is also the main source of U.S. ethanol. Cotton is the fourth-largest crop in acres planted, but more valuable on a per-acre basis and more suited to warmer climates than are corn and soybeans. Estimating the correct relationship between weather and yields for these major crops is a critical first step before more elaborate models can be used to examine how crop-planting choices, food and fiber supply, and prices will ultimately shift in response to climate change. Our data are comprised of new fine-scale weather outcomes merged together with a large panel of crop yields that spans most U.S. counties from 1950 to 2005. The new weather data include the length of time each crop is exposed to each one-degree Celsisus temperature interval in each day, summed across all days of the growing season, all estimated for the specific locations within each county where crops are grown. The new fine-scale weather data facilitate estimation of a flexible model that can detect nonlinearities and breakpoints in the effect of temperature on yield. If the true underlying relationship is nonlinear (e.g., increasing and then decreasing in temperature), averaging over time or space dilutes the true temperature response. For example, similar average temperatures may arise from two very different days, one with little temperature variation and one with wide temperature variation. Holding the average temperature constant, days with more variation will include more exposure to extreme outcomes, which can critically influence yields (9). The empirical challenge is to map an entire season of widely varying temperature outcomes to each year's yield. Accurate estimation of nonlinear effects is particularly important when considering large, nonmarginal changes in temperatures, now expected with climate change. Results Regression analyses, which control in various ways for precipitation , technological change, soils, and location-specific unob-served factors, all show a similar nonlinear relationship between temperature and yields. Additional results and sensitivity checks are given in the SI Appendix. Yield Growth Increases Gradually with Temperature up to 29-32\textdegree{} Celsius, Depending on the Crop, and then Decreases Sharply for All Three Crops. Estimates and standard errors of temperature effects for all three crops are displayed in Fig. 1. The figure has three frames, where each column represents one crop. Different specifications of the link between temperature and yield growth are indicated by the color of the estimated curve. The blue line shows the most flexible specification, a step function that fits a separate growth rate for each three-degree temperature range. The black line shows the specification where yield growth is modeled as an eighth-order polynomial function of temperature and the 95\% confidence band after adjusting for spatial correlation is added in gray. The red line shows a piecewise linear specification that follows the agronomic concept of degree days. Each specification shows the same characteristic shape, increasing modestly up to a critical temperature and then decreasing sharply. For corn, the critical threshold temperature is 29\textdegree{} C; for soybeans it is 30\textdegree{} C; and for cotton it is 32\textdegree{} C. The vertical axis in each figure marks the log of yield (bushels per acre for corn and soybeans and bales per acre for cotton) with the exposure-weighted average predicted yield normalized to zero. The horizontal axis is temperature. In comparing two points on any curve, a vertical difference of 0.01 indicates an},

The paper also investigates whether this participation has a different impact on sons as compared with daughters. The empirical analysis is based on household survey data from rural households in northern and eastern India. The results show that a mother's labour is not a substitute for, but a complement to, market and non-market child labour, while a mother's education, along with the father's education, reduces the likelihood of child labour. Gender-based analysis lends support to existing literature regarding the gender bias in domestic child labour. Additionally,},

Assuming that appropriate instruments are available, we propose several tests for selection bias and two estimation procedures that correct for selection in the presence of endogenous regressors. The tests are based on the fixed effects two-stage least squares estimator, thereby permitting arbitrary correlation between unobserved heterogeneity and explanatory variables. The first correction procedure is parametric and is valid under the assumption that the errors in the selection equation are normally distributed. The second procedure estimates the model parameters semiparametrically using series estimators. In the proposed testing and correction procedures, the error terms may be heterogeneously distributed and serially dependent in both selection and primary equations. Because these methods allow for a rather flexible structure of the error variance and do not impose any nonstandard assumptions on the conditional distributions of explanatory variables, they provide a useful alternative to the existing approaches presented in the literature.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to assess the changes in the severity and return periods of meteorological droughts during major cropping seasons of Nigeria for the period 1901\textendash 2010 in order to understand the impacts of climate variation on seasonal droughts. Gauge-based gridded global precipitation climatology center (GPCC) rainfall and climate research unit (CRU) potential evapotranspiration (PET) data having a spatial resolution of 0.5\textdegree{} were used for the reconstruction of droughts using standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). SPEI values were fitted with the best distribution function to estimate seasonal droughts return periods and the modified Mann-Kendall test was used to assess the secular changes in climate variables and drought index. The temporal variations in droughts and their interrelations with rainfall and temperature trends were assessed using a 50-year moving window with a 10-year time step. The results showed that meteorological drought severity has increased for all the cropping seasons of Nigeria. Temperature was found to be the dominating factor for defining droughts in semi-arid regions in the north while rainfall in the monsoon and tropical savanna climatic zones dominates in the south. Rises in temperature in the range of 0.14\textendash 0.42 \textdegree C/decade and almost no change in rainfall have caused decreases in SPEI up to -0.25/decade in some regions. The number of grid points with decreasing SPEI was found to vary between 50 out of 323 for millet and 152 for yam growing season. The moderate droughts were found to become more frequent compared to other classes of droughts. Amongst the cropping seasons, the highest increases in drought frequency were observed during corn growing season. The highest decrease in the median value of the return period of moderate, severe and extreme droughts during the two corn growing seasons were observed to be 6.25, 12.86 to 13.20, 23.15 to 24.31 years in 1901\textendash 1950 to 6.25, 12.92 to 12.94, 23.51 to 23.64 in 1961\textendash 2010. Compared to other drought severities, the return periods of the moderate droughts were found to decrease more. A general decrease in the return periods of droughts indicates more frequent droughts during all cropping seasons of Nigeria. Therefore, it can be concluded that the rising temperature due to global warming would increase drought severity and frequency in all the cropping seasons of Nigeria.},

These estimates may be required to measure general equilibrium welfare effects or to simulate intricate feedback loops between natural and economic processes. However, many of the assumptions used to recover structural estimates are untestable. The goal of reduced form studies is, conversely, to recover key parameters of interest using exogenous within-sample variation with as few structural assumptions as possible \textemdash{} reducing reliance on these assumptions assists in establishing causality in the relationship of interest.

  abstract = {Data from farmer-managed fields have not been used previously to disentangle the impacts of daily minimum and maximum temperatures and solar radiation on rice yields in tropical/subtropical Asia. We used a multiple regression model to analyze data from 227 intensively managed irrigated rice farms in six important rice-producing countries. The farm-level detail, observed over multiple growing seasons, enabled us to construct farm-specific weather variables, control for unobserved factors that either were unique to each farm but did not vary over time or were common to all farms at a given site but varied by season and year, and obtain more precise estimates by including farm-and site-specific economic variables. Temperature and radiation had statistically significant impacts during both the vegetative and ripening phases of the rice plant. Higher minimum temperature reduced yield, whereas higher maximum temperature raised it; radiation impact varied by growth phase. Combined, these effects imply that yield at most sites would have grown more rapidly during the high-yielding season but less rapidly during the low-yielding season if observed temperature and radiation trends at the end of the 20th century had not occurred, with temperature trends being more influential. Looking ahead, they imply a net negative impact on yield from moderate warming in coming decades. Beyond that, the impact would likely become more negative, because prior research indicates that the impact of maximum temperature becomes negative at higher levels. Diurnal temperature variation must be considered when investigating the impacts of climate change on irrigated rice in Asia. agriculture | climate change | dimming | diurnal temperature | global warming T he impacts of temperature and solar radiation on rice yield remain imperfectly understood, despite decades of agronomic research. Current knowledge is based primarily on field trials and greenhouse experiments. These experimental studies indicate that increased temperature (1-4) and decreased radiation (1, 3, 5) can reduce yield, with the impacts varying across the plant's three growth phases (vegetative, establishment to panicle initiation; reproductive, panicle initiation to flowering; ripening, flowering to mature grain). Unresolved issues remain with respect to the relative impacts of temperature during daytime (T max) vs. nighttime (T min), potentially confounding impacts of temperature and radiation , and the magnitude of impacts in nonexperimental settings. Here, we investigate these issues by analyzing data from the largest farm-level rice study conducted in Asia since the mid-1980s. We use disaggregated data from farmer-managed fields to disentangle the impacts of T min , T max , and solar radiation on rice yield. With few exceptions (6, 7), most statistical studies on temperature and rice yield have focused on the impact of daily mean temperature (T ave), despite evidence that that the effects of T min and T max on crop phenological development and physiological processes differ (4). It is well-established that extremely high levels of T max during flowering can drastically reduce rice yield because of spikelet sterility, but recent studies have provided evidence that yield might be more sensitive to T min than to T max in locations where spikelet sterility is rarely observed (8). Rice simulation models began to include T min and T max as separate variables only recently (4). Better understanding of the impacts of temperature at different points in the diurnal cycle is needed, because T min has been rising faster than T max in some important Asian rice-growing countries, including the two largest, China (9) and India (10), and is projected to continue doing so in the future (p 882 in ref. 11). Potentially confounding impacts of T min and radiation on rice yield in field experiments have attracted recent attention (8, 12), although this was recognized as a challenge for yield studies decades ago (5). The difficulty stems from the complex meteorological effects of clouds, which reduce not only insolation but also back radiation, thus possibly increasing T min by enhancing long-wave surface warming at night (12, 13). Understanding the relative impacts of T min and radiation is important in view of evidence of a declining trend in surface radiation (global dimming) (14), which probably results from increased cloudiness caused by a combination of global warming and regional brown clouds of aerosol pollution (13-16). A study based on a small number of annual observations (twelve) from a research station in the Philippines reported that the yield of irrigated rice decreased by 10\% for each 1 \textdegree C increase in T min averaged over the growing season (8). A reanalysis of the data from that study concluded that the actual impact of T min was much smaller, because T min was negatively correlated with radiation, thus confounding the observed impact of T min with the omitted impact of radiation (12). A recent review of the impacts of climate change on rice concluded that "the effect of high night temperature is not understood well" (p 75 in ref. 4). Although experimental studies are essential for understanding physiological relationships and constructing crop simulation models, they do not necessarily replicate real agricultural settings. Researchers typically apply agronomically optimal levels of inputs that are not being investigated, which can accentuate the impact of weather by making it the factor that limits yield. Data from farmer-managed fields allow one to study how weather affects yield in a setting in which farmers make decisions based on the weather they observe every day and the prices they pay for inputs and receive for harvested crops. Although other studies have used nonexperimental data to study the relationship between weather (or climate) and agriculture (17-21), including for rice (6, 7, 22), with one exception, they have analyzed aggregate data (e.g., na},
